## About
Laravel Video Chat is a project where one to one video/audio chat and text chat with translation features are available.
With the help of **laravel web sockets** and **Twilio Video** we are able to transmit the video/audio data from **peer to peer** without the intervention of server. Where as the text based messages are being sent in realtime via server translating the text into different languages on the fly. We are using **Vue, Laravel Echo and Pusher** in the front-end.
